      <h1>Student Grades Management</h1>
      <p>Our new project designed for students, teachers, and families to manage grades easily. One big problem is that grades take too long to show up or might not appear due to lots of 
        work or computer issues. This makes it hard for parents to know how well their kids are doing in school, 
        and students can't easily check their progress. Our project fixes this by making a computer system that 
        automatically calculates grades and uploads them quickly. It's simple for everyone to use, including students. 
        It helps students see how they're doing in school, and it helps teachers share grades with parents easily. 
        This project makes things easier for teachers and helps parents understand how their kids are doing in school. Plus, students can easily check their grades too. 'Easy Student Grade Manager' is a new way to keep school records simple and clear for everyone involved.</p>

      <p>Final CRUD Project entitled "Fish Inventory Management System"</p>
      <p><strong>Short Description: </strong> The Fish Inventory Management System helps users keep track of fish shipments effectively. It allows them to record details like the type of fish received, the quantity, arrival dates, and supplier information. Each type of fish is given a unique number to make it easy to identify and manage. The system also organizes fish inventory by type and storage location, making it simple to find specific products when needed.
         Detailed profiles are created for each fish type, containing important information such as purchase price, quality, expiry dates (if applicable), and sales history. This information helps in pricing fish accurately and planning restocking activities. All transactions related to inventory, including sales and adjustments, are recorded to ensure accurate stock levels and provide insights into how the inventory is moving within the business. 
         Additionally, users can generate reports based on inventory data, including summaries, stock levels, sales performance by fish type, supplier analysis, and trends. These reports are valuable for decision-making and improving inventory management practices.</p>
